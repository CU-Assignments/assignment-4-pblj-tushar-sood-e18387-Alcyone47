/* Hard Level: Ticket Booking System with Multithreading Problem Statement üìù Develop a ticket booking system with synchronized threads to ensure no double booking of seats. Use thread priorities to simulate VIP bookings being processed first.
Key Concepts Used üõ†Ô∏è Multithreading: To handle multiple booking requests simultaneously.
Synchronization: To prevent double booking of seats.
Thread Priorities: To prioritize VIP bookings over regular bookings.
How to Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Navigate to the Hard/ folder.
Compile and run the TicketBookingSystem.java file.
Observe how VIP bookings are prioritized and how synchronization prevents double booking. */
